Adding a new feature
====================
Adding a new feature to the software is as important as being able to add a new device to the setup. Science changes,
experiments change, and software should follow that behavior. In this page I will guide you step by step on how to add
a shutter to the experiment. The shutter will close right after a line scan is done and will stay closed for a fixed time
before a new scan starts. This prevents the sample from overheating due to the laser itself.

Identifying the needs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The first step, even if redundant, is where most users fail. Identifying the need means understanding what do you want to do and how do you plan to do it.
