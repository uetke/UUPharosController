The Experiment Class
====================

The experiment class holds all the logic for performing both complex and simple experiments. The Pharos Controller
triggered the inception of the separation of logic from models from GUI, and therefore it possesses a slightly more
primitive and down-to-earth approach. The Experimentor program has a more complete class, with specific inheritable methods.

Any user who is willing to develop new software should refer to the Experimentor and pehraps use the Pharos as an example
but not as a model to follow to the line.

What follows in this page is the documentation of the Measurement class, taken directly from the source code.
