# Configuration folder for the Pharos Controller #

This folder holds the most important files for configuring the behavior of the experiment. THere are two kind of files, YAML files and pure python. 

YAML files define parameters for the experiment that are thought to be customized by the user; for example the wavelength of a laser, the name of the devices plugged to a DAQ card, etc. 

Python files are thought to be used as a module for default values.
